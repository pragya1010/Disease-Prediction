Disease Prediction Application Based on Medical Imaging implementing Deep Learning and Python. Diagnosis for Breast Cancer, Malaria and Parkinson's disease.

The problem of error prone diagnosis could be solved using machine learning algorithm that can predict the disease from the medical image without the need for any other additional hardware.

We are implementing Neural networks using Keras, Random Forest Model and Image Analysis using OpenCV. 

To use the package:
1. pip install requirements.txt
2. Run api.py
The code will navigate to Index.html where u can login as a new user and use the application
